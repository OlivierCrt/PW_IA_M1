=============

presolving:
   (1.1s) running MILP presolver
   (1.4s) MILP presolver found nothing
(round 1, exhaustive) 0 del vars, 0 del conss, 0 add conss, 0 chg bounds, 0 chg sides, 0 chg coeffs, 32526 upgd conss, 0 impls, 0 clqs
   (3.6s) probing: 51/105 (48.6%) - 0 fixings, 0 aggregations, 0 implications, 0 bound changes
   (3.6s) probing aborted: 50/50 successive totally useless probings
   (3.8s) symmetry computation started: requiring (bin +, int +, cont +), (fixed: bin -, int -, cont -)
   (4.3s) no symmetry present (symcode time: 0.02)
presolving (2 rounds: 2 fast, 2 medium, 2 exhaustive):
 0 deleted vars, 0 deleted constraints, 0 added constraints, 0 tightened bounds, 0 added holes, 0 changed sides, 0 changed coefficients
 0 implications, 0 cliques
presolved problem has 105 variables (105 bin, 0 int, 0 impl, 0 cont) and 32541 constraints
